##### about my project

> The project revisits a previous school based intervention, the Stop Smoking Schools Trial (ASSIST for short). This was one of the first large scale interventions that focused on the relational vs individual level for health behaviour change. The program called on popular opinion leaders within their school-year cohorts to diffuse information around the hazards of smoking.
